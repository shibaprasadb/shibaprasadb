Shibaprasad Bhattacharya

I'm a data professional with a passion for using analytical methods to solve complex business challenges. My expertise spans data science, machine learning, and operations research, and I have a proven track record of applying these skills across diverse industries like pharma, logistics, and aviation.

My approach is always problem-first: I frame ambiguous challenges, identify the critical metrics that matter, and build data-driven solutions that cut timelines, optimize processes, and enable better decisions.

What I'm focused on:
I am currently working at Bristol Myers Squibb, where I'm focused on developing innovative solutions that drive efficiency and strategic decision-making in the life sciences space.
